#### CSS only Carousel

[Demo](https://css-only-carousel.surge.sh/) | [Source code](./practice_projects/html_css/006_basic_image_carousel_using_just_HTML_and_CSS/)

In this example, we create a simple image carousel using HTML and CSS. You can play around with anchor tags to make carousel effect. this is a good start to understand how a carousel actually works.

Please note that this is a basic example, and professional image carousel libraries provide more advanced features and optimizations. If you're looking for a production-ready image carousel, consider using popular JavaScript libraries like Slick, Owl Carousel, or Flickity.

It’s kind of amazing how far HTML and CSS will take you when building a carousel/slideshow.

Setting some boxes in a horizontal row with CSS Flexbox is easy.
Showing only one box at a time with overflow and making it swipable with overscroll-behavior is easy.
You can make the “slides” line up nicely with scroll-snap-type.
A couple of #jump-links is all you need to make navigation for it, which you can make all nice and smooth with scroll-behavior.
