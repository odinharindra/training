            A web developer’s job is to

            role is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web
            developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and capacity.

          <h2 class="content-title">Types of web developers</h2>
          <p class="content-description">
            Web developers usually fall under one of three categories:
            <span class="highlited">back-end developers</span>,
            <span class="highlited">front-end developers</span>, and
            <span class="highlited">full-stack developers</span>. Some web developers also work as
            webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these roles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website’s structure, write code,
              and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access
              points for others who need to manage a website’s content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Front-end web developers</strong> work on the visual part of the website—the
              pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design
              the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to
              enhance the site. You can gain essential front-end web development skills with this
              full-time

              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full-stack developers</strong> do the work of both a back-end and front-end
              developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may
              work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary
              responsibility is to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and
              applications on each page work properly.
