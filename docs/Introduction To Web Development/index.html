          <p class="content-description">
            A web developer’s job is to create websites/Web applications. While their primary role
            is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers
            are also responsible for the website’s performance and capacity.

          <h2 class="content-title">Types of web developers</h2>
          <p class="content-description">
            Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers,
            front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as
            webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these roles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website’s structure, write code,
              and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access
              points for others who need to manage a website’s content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Front-end web developers</strong> work on the visual part of the website—the
              pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design
              the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to
              enhance the site. You can gain essential front-end web development skills with this
              full-time

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full-stack developers</strong> do the work of both a back-end and front-end
              developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may
              work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary
              responsibility is to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and
              applications on each page work properly.

            As a web developer, you could work for a company or agency, or as a freelancer taking on
            projects for individual clients. Your tasks will vary depending on your work situation,
            but day-to-day responsibilities might generally include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing user interfaces and navigation menus</li>
            <li>Writing and reviewing code for sites, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
