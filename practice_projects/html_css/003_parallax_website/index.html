        Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this website. My programming
        journey started back in 2019, few months before I started studying CSE in LNCT Bhopal. I am
        currently in my second year and doing Technical Content Writing Internship at Odinschool. I
        like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding numbers to the complex ones
        like competitive programming problems. I love making projects and games. Infact this website
        is one of my Web Development Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.<br />
        <br />Languages known : C Language, C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, MySQL.<br />
        IT Constructs : Data Structures and Algorithm, OOP, HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
